            <p id="about">  5 Seconds of Summer (5SOS) are a 4 man pop rock band originating from Australia, Sydney, New South Wales formed
                in 2011. The members consists of Luke Hemmings, Ashton Irwin, Calum Hood and Michael Clifford. They started out 
                their careers through YouTube just by posting cover videos of themselves and eventually got recognised by other
                famous bands such as One direction who invited 5sos to tour with them in their album Take me home. Since then,
                they have produced 3 studio albums. 1 in early 2014 where they released their first album "She looks so perfect" 
                where it reached number 1 both in Australia and the UK. Their second album was called "5 seconds of summer" 
                where it reached number 1 in 11 countries. Finally after a lengthy break from the music industry, they released
                their third album called "Youngblood" in late 2018 which has proven to be big hit becoming their third album to top
                the charts in their home country. Furthermore especially with their single hit"Youngblood" becoming their highest
                charting single to date on the US billboard hot 100. The band has had to make changes to the type of music they
                make from previous more upbeat tunes to slower and more mature.
